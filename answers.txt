1: Selection sort only swaps in the outside loop. Bubble sort performs swaps during outside loop as well as inner loop. More swaps means Bubble Sort will be slower.

2: Insertion sort doesn't iterate through entire array during the inner loop, while Selection sort does. So Insertion is checking less elements, and therefore is faster.

3: It needs to have something to compare by overloading the < operator.

4: It probably sacrifices space for more speed. With more memory being used, the speed can be increased.
